      The Data from a YML file lands in a database via seed.rb.Next the data populates a formular(Simple_From) with checkboxes and text fields.After clicking a button 'Click - check...'
      is displayed a percentage of security(real logic not implemented, 'placeholder logic').

      The collected Data Choices are being saved into a.docx(word document - setup with Caracal Gem).The Data can be manipulated directly in agreeements_controller.rb.The structure of the.docx document is of course not real and definitly not final - due to know - how protecting.The doc is being send to an E - Mail(configured with Postfix).A safety copy of the document is being stored to a folder as well.

      Next steps: 1) exchange yml
    for csv to make it excel compatable.,
      2) Changing structure of the Form(add text - field with prefilled text that can be changed.)
  It might be cool to use React(easy following changes) - so I am learning React now and will come back to this project very soon(hopefully).
